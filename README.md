# U.S. National Parks Alexa Skill
Experience the U.S. national parks through voice and sound clips. Hear a waterfall at Yosemite, a geyser at Yellowstone, a volcano at Hawaii Volcanoes, and a bear at Great Smoky Mountains.

Request a specific U.S. national park to get a brief sound clip of a typical activity or sight at the park, followed by a description of the park provided by the [NPS API](https://developer.nps.gov/api/). You can then find ask for location, general directions, or the current weather ([OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api/)).

To get a list of parks located in a particular state, say the state name.
